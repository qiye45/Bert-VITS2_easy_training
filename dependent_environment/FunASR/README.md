# FunASR: A Fundamental End-to-End Speech Recognition Toolkit


[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/funasr)](https://pypi.org/project/funasr/)


<strong>FunASR</strong> hopes to build a bridge between academic research and industrial applications on speech recognition. By supporting the training & finetuning of the industrial-grade speech recognition model, researchers and developers can conduct research and production of speech recognition models more conveniently, and promote the development of speech recognition ecology. ASR for FunÔºÅ

## Highlights
- FunASR is a fundamental speech recognition toolkit that offers a variety of features, including speech recognition (ASR), Voice Activity Detection (VAD), Punctuation Restoration, Language Models, Speaker Verification, Speaker Diarization and multi-talker ASR. FunASR provides convenient scripts and tutorials, supporting inference and fine-tuning of pre-trained models.
- We have released a vast collection of academic and industrial pretrained models on the [ModelScope](https://www.modelscope.cn/models?page=1&tasks=auto-speech-recognition) and [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/FunASR), which can be accessed through our [Model Zoo](https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/FunASR/blob/main/docs/model_zoo/modelscope_models.md). The representative [Paraformer-large](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/damo/speech_paraformer-large_asr_nat-zh-cn-16k-common-vocab8404-pytorch/summary), a non-autoregressive end-to-end speech recognition model, has the advantages of high accuracy, high efficiency, and convenient deployment, supporting the rapid construction of speech recognition services. For more details on service deployment, please refer to the [service deployment document](runtime/readme_cn.md).

More detailed information about service deployment can be found in the [deployment roadmap]&#40;funasr/runtime/readme_cn.md&#41;.)


<a name="quick-start"></a>
## Quick Start

Below is a quick start tutorial. Test audio files ([Mandarin](https://isv-data.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/ics/MaaS/ASR/test_audio/vad_example.wav), [English]()).

### Command-line usage

```shell
funasr ++model=paraformer-zh ++vad_model="fsmn-vad" ++punc_model="ct-punc" ++input=asr_example_zh.wav
```

Notes: Support recognition of single audio file, as well as file list in Kaldi-style wav.scp format: `wav_id wav_pat`

### Speech Recognition (Non-streaming)
```python
from funasr import AutoModel
# paraformer-zh is a multi-functional asr model
# use vad, punc, spk or not as you need
model = AutoModel(model="paraformer-zh",  vad_model="fsmn-vad",  punc_model="ct-punc-c", 
                  # spk_model="cam++", 
                  )
res = model.generate(input=f"{model.model_path}/example/asr_example.wav", 
                     batch_size_s=300, 
                     hotword='È≠îÊê≠')
print(res)
```
Note: `hub`: represents the model repository, `ms` stands for selecting ModelScope download, `hf` stands for selecting Huggingface download.

### Speech Recognition (Streaming)
```python
from funasr import AutoModel

chunk_size = [0, 10, 5] #[0, 10, 5] 600ms, [0, 8, 4] 480ms
encoder_chunk_look_back = 4 #number of chunks to lookback for encoder self-attention
decoder_chunk_look_back = 1 #number of encoder chunks to lookback for decoder cross-attention

model = AutoModel(model="paraformer-zh-streaming")

import soundfile
import os

wav_file = os.path.join(model.model_path, "example/asr_example.wav")
speech, sample_rate = soundfile.read(wav_file)
chunk_stride = chunk_size[1] * 960 # 600ms

cache = {}
total_chunk_num = int(len((speech)-1)/chunk_stride+1)
for i in range(total_chunk_num):
    speech_chunk = speech[i*chunk_stride:(i+1)*chunk_stride]
    is_final = i == total_chunk_num - 1
    res = model.generate(input=speech_chunk, cache=cache, is_final=is_final, chunk_size=chunk_size, encoder_chunk_look_back=encoder_chunk_look_back, decoder_chunk_look_back=decoder_chunk_look_back)
    print(res)
```
Note: `chunk_size` is the configuration for streaming latency.` [0,10,5]` indicates that the real-time display granularity is `10*60=600ms`, and the lookahead information is `5*60=300ms`. Each inference input is `600ms` (sample points are `16000*0.6=960`), and the output is the corresponding text. For the last speech segment input, `is_final=True` needs to be set to force the output of the last word.

### Voice Activity Detection (Non-Streaming)
```python
from funasr import AutoModel

model = AutoModel(model="fsmn-vad")
wav_file = f"{model.model_path}/example/asr_example.wav"
res = model.generate(input=wav_file)
print(res)
```
Note: The output format of the VAD model is: `[[beg1, end1], [beg2, end2], ..., [begN, endN]]`, where `begN/endN` indicates the starting/ending point of the `N-th` valid audio segment, measured in milliseconds.

### Voice Activity Detection (Streaming)
```python
from funasr import AutoModel

chunk_size = 200 # ms
model = AutoModel(model="fsmn-vad")

import soundfile

wav_file = f"{model.model_path}/example/vad_example.wav"
speech, sample_rate = soundfile.read(wav_file)
chunk_stride = int(chunk_size * sample_rate / 1000)

cache = {}
total_chunk_num = int(len((speech)-1)/chunk_stride+1)
for i in range(total_chunk_num):
    speech_chunk = speech[i*chunk_stride:(i+1)*chunk_stride]
    is_final = i == total_chunk_num - 1
    res = model.generate(input=speech_chunk, cache=cache, is_final=is_final, chunk_size=chunk_size)
    if len(res[0]["value"]):
        print(res)
```
Note: The output format for the streaming VAD model can be one of four scenarios:
- `[[beg1, end1], [beg2, end2], .., [begN, endN]]`ÔºöThe same as the offline VAD output result mentioned above.
- `[[beg, -1]]`ÔºöIndicates that only a starting point has been detected.
- `[[-1, end]]`ÔºöIndicates that only an ending point has been detected.
- `[]`ÔºöIndicates that neither a starting point nor an ending point has been detected. 

The output is measured in milliseconds and represents the absolute time from the starting point.
### Punctuation Restoration
```python
from funasr import AutoModel

model = AutoModel(model="ct-punc")
res = model.generate(input="ÈÇ£‰ªäÂ§©ÁöÑ‰ºöÂ∞±Âà∞ËøôÈáåÂêß happy new year ÊòéÂπ¥ËßÅ")
print(res)
```
### Timestamp Prediction
```python
from funasr import AutoModel

model = AutoModel(model="fa-zh")
wav_file = f"{model.model_path}/example/asr_example.wav"
text_file = f"{model.model_path}/example/text.txt"
res = model.generate(input=(wav_file, text_file), data_type=("sound", "text"))
print(res)
```

More examples ref to [docs](https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/FunASR/tree/main/examples/industrial_data_pretraining)


## Export ONNX

### Command-line usage
```shell
funasr-export ++model=paraformer ++quantize=false ++device=cpu
```

### Python
```python
from funasr import AutoModel

model = AutoModel(model="paraformer", device="cpu")

res = model.export(quantize=False)
```

### Text ONNX
```python
# pip3 install -U funasr-onnx
from funasr_onnx import Paraformer
model_dir = "damo/speech_paraformer-large_asr_nat-zh-cn-16k-common-vocab8404-pytorch"
model = Paraformer(model_dir, batch_size=1, quantize=True)

wav_path = ['~/.cache/modelscope/hub/damo/speech_paraformer-large_asr_nat-zh-cn-16k-common-vocab8404-pytorch/example/asr_example.wav']

result = model(wav_path)
print(result)
```
